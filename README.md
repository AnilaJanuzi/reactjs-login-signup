# Login & Signup with ReactJS

This is a simple login and signup page built using ReactJS. The project provides basic front-end functionality for user authentication, including:

- A login form
- A signup form

# Current Status
 The login and signup forms are created purely for frontend display and functionality. No backend or database has been connected yet to handle user data or authentication.

# Features:

- Login page with email and password fields.
- Signup page with name, email, and password fields.
- Basic form validation.

# Future Improvements:
- Connect to a backend API for user authentication.
- Implement secure login with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Integrate with a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, etc.) to store user data.
