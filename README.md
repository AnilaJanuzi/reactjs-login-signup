# Login & Signup with ReactJS

This is a simple login and signup page built using ReactJS. The project provides basic front-end functionality for user authentication, including:

- A login form
- A signup form

## Current Status

Please note that this implementation is not fully functional at the moment. The login and signup forms are created purely for frontend display and functionality. No backend or database has been connected yet to handle user data or authentication.

### Features:

- Login page with email and password fields.
- Signup page with name, email, and password fields.
- Basic form validation.

### Future Improvements:
- Connect to a backend API for user authentication.
- Implement secure login with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Integrate with a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, etc.) to store user data.
